<b>Question I am trying to answer - </b> <br>
You work as a product manager for an agriculture products company in California that grows and sells five different types of produce: 1) tomatoes, 2) spring potatoes, 3) tangerines 4) grapefruit 5) avocados. Over the past five years the relative amount that each has contributed to overall income has shifted. Five years ago, grapefruit was the top seller, while today it’s dead last. Over the last five years you generally notice there’s a clear decline in citrus products, but avocados have come on strong. You’re preparing the strategic recommendation for the relative investment the company will make in its crops for the next five years. You want to clearly present the shift you’ve seen over the last five years. What form will you use to present this observation? (10 points)


<b>My perspective of looking at it - </b><br>
As a product manager, I want to show the shift in the sales of the agricultural products over the last five years. The important point in the requirement mentioned is - this is the ‘relative’ amount that each individual product that contributes to the total sales of the company. So, as a product manager, I would like to see the change in the relative contributions of each product over the last five years.

Presentation Style for dashboard – </b><br>For the above-mentioned analysis, the dashboard must have a ‘stacked bar graph’ and a ‘line chart’. Stacked bar graph will have Year on the X-axis and Sales Amount on Y-Axis. Each bar will be distributed in the 5 product categories as per their sales amount for that year.


A line chart may accompany the stacked bar graph just to get a glimpse of which product is improving and which product is going down. Also, we can add a Pie-chart (optional), just to show the percentage of total sales product-wise and year-wise.
Also, the executives, for which I am making the presentation, might want to see overall amount each time I select a product or year on the dashboard to quickly get an idea.


As Stephan Few (Visualization expert) suggests, Quantitative information consists not only of numbers, but also of data that identifies what the numbers mean. It consists of quantitative data – the numbers – and categorical data – the labels that tell us what the numbers measure. Line chart with each line representing sales by product and year on X-axis will get us a clear picture of which product is constantly growing, which product is constantly declining and which product is variable or fluctuating constantly and get us the time series analysis over last five years at a single look.

<b> Analysis</b><br>
Now in the dashboard, we can clearly see that grapefruit is not giving the % of total revenue it was giving in the earlier years. Whereas, Avocado is generating higher revenue contributions in the total revenues. The citric products (Grapefruit and tangerine) are on a decline which is what the SVP may be interested in seeing to plan some strategy to get the sales up for those products.


<b>Directions for viewing dashboard</b>: -<br>
The dashboard gives percentage of sales revenue by product (Donut chart), Sales revenue (Number Pad), Relative contributions to sales revenue by product by year (Stacked bar chart), and time-series trend analysis (line chart with trend-line functionality)
Make a selection on the donut on the top left corner to see other changes in other graphs. The stacked chart will show the contribution in each year. The line chart will show the time-series trend and a trend-line in the line chart (dotted) will help predicting where the sales are going! Hovering over graphs would help a lot!
