Consider the following question - 

You work in sales operations as an analyst. There’s a new SVP of Sales coming into the company who will want to quickly understand some information about how different regions are currently staffed and performing. You’ve been asked to provide a single report which shows sales headcount and bookings to date for the current quarter compared to budgeted headcount and bookings. This will quickly give her the basic information she needs as she has individual introductory meetings with each of the regional sales heads in North America, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. What manner of presenting the information will serve the purpose most effectively? (10 points)


The requirements are to analyze staffing and bookings for the current quarter and compare it with budgeted headcount and bookings for all the regions like North America, Europe, Asia Pacific etc.
As the SVP wants to quickly view this on a single report/dashboard where he can get the whole big picture. The perfect presentation would be to design a dashboard with map, bar graphs.


Map will have the regions highlighted and the circles on the locations will be sized according to the amount of sales in that particular location. For example, Asia Pacific sales are more than North America, then the circle representing Asia Pacific will be bigger than that of North America. (My assumption here is booking are considered as amount in USD; although it could have been the quantity as well; but I prefer currency!)


The bar graph, which is the best representation for comparisons, will compare the actual and budgeted headcounts and bookings. Two separate bar graphs for headcount comparison and bookings comparison would be great for ease of use and aesthetics/look of the dashboard.


I have also included monthly comparison of budgeted vs actual bookings (sales) because, this is a dashboard for quarter. So the SVP might be interested in looking which month in this quarter preformed as per budgeted estimates.
Also, another important visualization can be a KPI indicator graph or NumberPad. This indicates growth or downfall over the selected criteria. KPI indicators can be set as per our need. For example, here in our example, actual headcount is lower than the budgeted headcount, that is considered as good. Whereas if actual booking amount is greater than budgeted, then that is considered as good. The KPI also shows deflection from the goal; which is here budgeted value. Including such special presentation types catch the eye quickly and help us understand the big picture.

Directions for using dashboard: -
Top left corner bar chart shows the region-wise headcount comparison; where as top right corner bar chart shows monthly sales comparison (budgeted vs actual).
Make a selection on any of those bar graphs. (trying both would be awesome!) 
The KPI numbers change as we make selection. (Please click again on the selection you made to undo it!) 
The line chart below shows overall trend and filters data quickly as per our selection. (For example, try clicking on the August Month in the top right corner graph)
